## License

MIT like, to be determined later.

No Warranty, accept at your own risk

## Profile

Publicly distributable elements of my bash profile are available for your use or inspection. Tested somewhat on macOS systems, no clue why it fails or succeeds in anything else. 

## Dependancies

idk, maybe bash 4.x. macOS ships with bash 3.x, so likely install via [Brew](brew.sh) or whatever means you prefer

### Installation

1. Clone the repo somewhere on your machine.
2. `cd` to the `profile` directory
3. Run `install.sh`
4. Check your `.bashrc` file for correctness.

### macOS Termainal Color themes

In the `profile` directory is a `color` directory for macOS Termainal.
